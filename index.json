With a simple command like squad_dataset = load_dataset(\u0026quot;squad\u0026quot;), get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX), efficient data pre-processing: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the above public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV/JSON/text. With simple commands like tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_example), efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.

Unlike the existing state-of-the-art toolkits, such as Stanza, that adopt an independent model for each task, N-LTP adopts the multi-task framework by using a shared pre-trained model, which has the advantage of capturing the shared knowledge across relevant Chinese tasks.\nIn addition, knowledge distillation where the single-task model teaches the multi-task model is further introduced to encourage the multi-task model to surpass its single-task teacher.\nFinally, we provide a collection of easy-to-use APIs and a visualization tool to make users easier to use and view the processing results directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first toolkit to support six Chinese NLP fundamental tasks.\n","permalink":"https://alongwy.top/publications/n-ltp-a-open-source-neural-chinese-language-technology-platform-with-pretrained-models/","tags":["EMNLP","Python","Pytorch","Demo","Chinese"],"title":"N-LTP: A Open-source Neural Chinese Language Technology Platform with Pretrained Models"},{"categories":null,"contents":"NotCraft::NotFeed An RSS reader running entirely from your GitHub repo.\n Free hosting on GitHub Pages.
